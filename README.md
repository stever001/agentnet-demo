# AgentNet

## Description  
AgentNet is an open-source, AI-native web infrastructure project that enables websites to become intelligent, queryable agents. It empowers developers and publishers to expose structured knowledge from their sites via a simple publishing protocol and interface, drastically reducing compute overhead compared to traditional LLM workflows. AgentNet combines declarative web semantics with an efficient retrieval layer to support real-time AI querying and content interaction.

**Key features:**
- Structured agent publishing and discovery  
- Developer-friendly publishing API  
- Graph-based data model with JSON-LD support  
- Lightweight Express backend with MySQL  
- Vite + React frontend with Chakra UI  
- Concurrent dev server launch using `concurrently`
